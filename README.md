# What
A place to put down your eBike battery. If you have the same battery I have ...

Fits my battery with a label that reads "Joycube JCEB360-11-S" used on my Momas F2 fatbike with a Bafang 400 electrical engine.

# Why
It takes up more room laying down, and it's a bit awkward to balance it standing up.

# How
Did some measures and plopped them into Autodesk Fusion 360.

# Issues
The first prototype I printed fit the battery very well, and was stable.

The first version I printed with better quality with some "improvements" to easier put the battery down have too much leeway, and the battery tips slightly forward. I think this could be fixed by having 1-3 mm more material at the lowermost part of the hole. I have added 2 mm more there in the models, but I haven't tried to print it myself yet after that change.

Battery is sadly leaning slightly forward. I think this should be fixed in the uploaded models, but haven't printed them myself.
